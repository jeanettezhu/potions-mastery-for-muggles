### Credits
*Potions Mastery for Muggles* was inspired by J.K. Rowling's *Harry Potter* series and Pottermore. It incorporates characters, items, audio, and art created by Rowling, *Harry Potter*-related media developers, and other independent artists primarily found on DeviantArt. However, the game design, UI/UX, code, logo, and image edits were developed by me.
